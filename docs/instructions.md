# Instructions

## Pull changes from the **upstream** repository {{site.data.assignment.upstream}}
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
1. Use the **View on GitHub** button to go to your repository on GitHub (in a browser).
1. On GitHub you should see a line right above the branch selection button that tells you how your fork compares to the original (upstream) version. **You should see that you are behind the SKHS-GDP-2019-2020 version.**
1. Click on the **Pull Request** button underneath the green **Clone or Download** button.
1. The pull request dialog will almost certainly be reversed, it will read (something like):

   ```SKHS-GDP-2019-2020/Prototype-1:master < Your-Username/Prototype-1:master```

## Enable GitHub Pages for your repository

1. This, then
1. That, and finally
1. The other thing
