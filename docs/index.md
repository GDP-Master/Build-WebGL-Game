# Overview

Let's make the prototype playable outside of our classroom. Unity provides a nubmer of options for "releasing" your prototype. You can easily build your prototype for:
* The web (WebGL).
* Native play on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

With a bit more effort, we can build for Android, iOS, and tvOS devices, let me know if you're interested.

We'll start by leaning how to do WebGL builds, they can be hosted on GitHub.
