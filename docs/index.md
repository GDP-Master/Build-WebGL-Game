# Overview

Let's make the prototype playable outside of our classroom. Unity provides a number of options for "releasing" your prototype. You can easily build a version to play:
* In a browser.
* Natively on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

With a bit more effort, we can build for Android, iOS, and tvOS devices, let me know if you're interested.

We'll start by leaning how to do WebGL build to play in a browser, they can be hosted on GitHub and can be played on any device that can access the web - although the user interface will need some work to play well on a phone.
